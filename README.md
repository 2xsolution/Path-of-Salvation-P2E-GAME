# 🔥 Description
`Paths of Salvation Game`  will change worlds every 2 months (Samurai, Western, Vikings, and Sci-Fi).
<p>
Each player will own a plot that it will be their base. In each base they can build four production buildings and a town center. All five buildings will have max 20 levels. In town center the player will have the option to send their Wolf on a mission to get loot(XP and gOxy). The goal of the player is to max out the buildings to receive the maximum loot. From there we will determine the rank of each player based on their XP and at the end of the world season (2 months) will distribute Oxygen based on their rank.</p>

`Production Buildings`

For each level of the buildings the production rate, the materials needed for the upgrade and the time of construction will increase. 

`Materials`

In each world they will have three based materials, wood, rock, and gold. The fourth will change for each world.

Samurai era: Tatam
Western era: Animal hide
Vikings era: Turf
Sci-Fi era: Metal

`Daily Mission`

Each day they can send their Wolf(NFT) on a mission. They will have three options each day. The number of rewards is based on the level of town center.
